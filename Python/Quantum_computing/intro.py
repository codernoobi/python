# projectq: ProjectQ can emulate a quantum computer on any CPU
# quantum logic gates such as Pauli-X, CNOT etc to Qubits.

# The Hadamard gate takes one input, and maps the output with a equal probability of being 1 or 0, i.e. 
# create a superposition where the input can be either 1 or 0 at the same time.

# 1. Create a new Qubit
# 2. Applying a Hadamard gate to the Qubit to put it into a superposition of equal probability of being 0 and 1.
# 3. Measuring the Qubit
