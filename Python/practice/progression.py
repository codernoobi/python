AP
If ‘a’ is the first term and ‘d’ is the common difference,
nth term of an AP = a + (n-1) d
Arithmetic Mean = Sum of all terms in the AP / Number of terms in the AP
Sum of ‘n’ terms of an AP = 0.5 n (first term + last term) = 0.5 n [ 2a + (n-1) d ]

GP
If ‘a’ is the first term and ‘r’ is the common ratio,
nth term of a GP = a rn-1
Geometric Mean = nth root of product of n terms in the GP
Sum of ‘n’ terms of a GP (r < 1) = [a (1 – rn)] / [1 – r]
Sum of ‘n’ terms of a GP (r > 1) = [a (rn – 1)] / [r – 1]
Sum of infinite terms of a GP (r < 1) = (a) / (1 – r)

HP
A sequence of numbers is called a harmonic progression if the reciprocal of the terms are in AP. In simple terms, a,b,c,d,e,f are in HP if 1/a, 1/b, 1/c, 1/d, 1/e, 1/f are in AP.
For two terms ‘a’ and ‘b’,
Harmonic Mean = (2 a b) / (a + b)
For two numbers, if A, G and H are respectively the arithmetic, geometric and harmonic means, then
A ≥ G ≥ H
A H = G2, i.e., A, G, H are in GP
