machine learning applications
algorithms

Python lib
numpy - mathematical
scipy - scientifical
matplotlib - plot 2d, 3d
pandas
scikitlearn - contains algorithms for ml
designed to work with numpy scipy
Most of the tasks that need to be done in a machine learning pipeline are implemented
already in scikit learn, including, pre-processing of data, feature selection, feature extraction,
train/test splitting, defining the algorithms, fitting models, tuning parameters, prediction,
evaluation, and exporting the model


supervised
labled data
ml algo for classfication, regression

unsupervised
unlabled data
use clustering
