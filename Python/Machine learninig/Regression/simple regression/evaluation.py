# Evaluation
# we compare the actual values and predicted values to calculate the accuracy of a regression model.
# Evaluation metrics provide a key role in the development of a model, as it provides insight to areas that
# require improvement.

# There are different model evaluation metrics, lets use MSE here to calculate the accuracy of our model
# based on the test set: 
#     - Mean absolute error: It is the mean of the absolute value of the errors. 
#     This is the easiest of the metrics to understand since it’s just average error.
#     - Mean Squared Error (MSE): Mean Squared Error (MSE) is the mean of the squared error. 
#     It’s more popular than Mean absolute error because the focus is geared more towards large errors. 
#     This is due to the squared term exponentially increasing larger errors in comparison to smaller ones.
#     - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
#     - R-squared is not error, but is a popular metric for accuracy of your model. 
#     It represents how close the data are to the fitted regression line. 
#     The higher the R-squared, the better the model fits your data. 
#     Best possible score is 1.0 and it can be negative (because the model can be arbitrarily worse).
