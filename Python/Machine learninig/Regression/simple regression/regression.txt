use regression methods to predict a continuous value
regression is the process of predicting a continuous value
In regression there are two types of variables: a dependent variable and one or more independent
variables
The dependent variable(Y) can be seen as the "state", "target" or "final goal" we study
and try to predict, and the independent variables(X), also known as explanatory variables, can be
seen as the "causes" of those "states"

linear regression
Simple linear regression is when one independent variable is used to estimate
a dependent variable
When more than one independent variable is
present, the process is called multiple linear regression

the error is the distance from the data point to the fitted regression line
Mathematically, it can be shown by the equation, mean squared error(MSE)
find a line where the mean of all these errors is minimized
minimize MSE

using a mathematic formula to find the θ0 and θ1.(y=mx+c   m=theta1  c=theta0)
It also doesn’t require tuning of parameters. So, something like tuning the K parameter
in K-Nearest Neighbors or the learning rate in Neural Networks isn’t something to worry
about. Linear Regression is also easy to understand
