"""
to be able experiment with the code examples in this tutorial, you should have MySQL installed on your computer.
You can download a free MySQL database at 			https://www.mysql.com/downloads/.

Python needs a MySQL driver to access the MySQL database.
In this tutorial we will use the driver "MySQL Connector".
We recommend that you use PIP to install "MySQL Connector".
PIP is most likely already installed in your Python environment.

Navigate your command line to the location of PIP, and type the following
python -m pip install mysql-connector
